# Traffic-Accident-Predictor-Models

## Description 
The purpose of this project is to make a model that answers our 3 hypothesis: 

 1. Reckless drivers are more likely to drive coupes or convertibles
 2. SUVs and minivans are less likely to be involved in serious car accidents
 3. More severe accidents occur past midnight (12:00am - 3:59am)

Included is also a pdf of a powerpoint to show our process and findings for the hypothesis
